Lee Ann Jack

I am a dedicated, energetic, deadline driven, budget meeting creative with many years of experience in successfully servicing companies with their web and print design needs. My goal is to design and develop effective web graphics, websites and print materials that grab the target audienceâ€™s attention, stay true to corporate image/policy, meet deadlines and are within budget. 
I bring ideas to life and on time. I am a multi-talented creative with proven skills in design, coding, writing, editing, proofreading, publicity, marketing, event planning and event management.
